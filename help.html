	  <p>Clovis (ruled 481-511) extended his authority over the other Franks and conquered all of Gaul. His successors of the Merovingian dynasty (named after Clovis' grandfather Merovich) ruled until displaced by the Carlongian family in the 8th century.</p>

	  <p><strong>Theodoric (455 - 526)</strong></p>

	  <p>As conqueror of Italy Theodoric the Great was the second Barbarian to rule as king in Italy after the fall of the Roman empire.</p>
	  <p>Theodoric was a Ostrogothic chieftain who led his people into Bulgaria, and threatened to move to Constantinople. The emperor of the Eastern Roman empire hastily appointed Theodoric king of Italy in order to divert the Ostrogoths from invading the Eastern empire.</p>
	  <p>Italy at that time was ruled by Odoacer. Odoacer was the Germanic commander of the Roman army who had deposed the last Roman emperor in the West.</p>
	  <p>Theodoric invaded Italy in 489, forcing Odoacer to take refuge in Ravenna. The city surrendered in 493; Theodoric invited Odoacer to a banquet and there killed him.</p>

	  <p><strong>Monastic Movement in Egypt.</strong></p>
	  <p>Antonius is the founder of the monastic movement in Egypt.</p>
	  <p>He began to practice an ascetic life at the age of 20. He took to heart the saying of Jesus in Matthew: 'sell what you possess and give to the poor.' He therefore preached simplicity and the practise of poverty. Antonius withdrew for absolute solitude to a mountain by the Nile. Around 305 he emerged from his retreat to organize the monastic life of the hermits who imitated him.</p>

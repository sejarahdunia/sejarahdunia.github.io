	  <p><strong>Battle of Hastings (1066)</strong></p>
	  <p>The Battle of Hastings resulted in the conquest of England by the Normans and is ranked as one of the battles that changed the course of history.</p>
	  <p>Harold Godwinson became king of England in 1066, after his father Edward died. But  William of Normandy claimed that Edward - his cousin - had promised the English throne to him.</p>
	  <p>The King of Norway also claimed the English throne and invaded northern England. Harold marched up north and defeated the Norse at the Battle of  Stamford Bridge. (This was the last great battle in more than 200 years of Anglo-Scandinavian conflict). In Harold's abscence, William landed his army in southern England without opposition.</p>
	  <p>Harold rushed south and met William's invading troops near the town of Hastings. He almost won a victory. The Norman cavalry wore itself out in charges up a hill that was held by Harold's men. Then the Normans pretended to retreat in disorder, causing the English militia on the flanks to storm down the hill in pursuit. The Norman knights split the English formation, cutting the separate units of the enemy army to pieces.</p>
	  <p>After William defeated and killed Harold he became the first Norman King of England as  William I, the Conqueror.</p>

	  <p>As a result of the investiture con-troversy (wether bishops should be appointed by the pope or emperor) Henry IV deposed the pope, the pope in return excommunicated the emperor.</p>
	  <p>The opposition of the German princes forced Henry to travel to Canossa in Italy and beg for absolution from the pope (Penance at Canossa 1077).</p>
	  <p>Following a second excommunica-tion Henry IV nominated the archbishop of Ravenna as antipope. Besieged by the reform movement led by pope Urban II (the successor of Gregory VII) Henry IV was forced to abdicate in 1106, the same year he died at Liege.</p>

	  <p><strong>Crusade</strong></p>
	  <p>The Crusader movement was evoked by the advance of the Seljuk Turks, who had taken Jerusalem from the Fatimid caliphs of Egypt and decisively defeated the Byzantine army in the battle of Manzikert.<br/>
	  Alarmed the Byzantine emperor appealed to Rome for help which presented the pope with a golden opportunity to reassert his supremacy over the eastern Church which had broken away from Rome in AD 1054.<br/>
	  At the same time pilgrimages to Jerusalem had encountered increased hostility from the Seljuks which led Pope Urban II to preach a Holy War against the heathens.<br/>
	  The first Crusade (1096-99) led to the successful storming of Jerusalem and the establishment of the kingdom of Jerusalem and other crusader states.<br/>
	  The second Crusade (1147-9) was led by the emperor Conrad III and by Louis VII of France, but foundered on quarrels between its leaders and the barons of Jerusalem, who were in alliance with Moslem Damascus, which the Crsuaders wished to attack.</p>
	  <p>The third Crusade (1189-92) was led by emperor Frederick I Barbarossa (who died before reaching Jerusalem); King Richard I of England and King Philip II Augustus of France. It failed to regain Jerusalem, which had been captured by the Moslem leader Saladin in 1187, but gained the concession that pilgrimages to Jersusalem were allowed. Despite some successes the crusades failed to check the Turkish advance.</p>
	  <p>The climax came in 1204 when the Fourth Crusade became an attack on the Greek (Byzantine) empire instead of the Moslems. The Crusaders captured Constantinople and set up a short-lived Latin Empire (1204-61). The main beneficiaries were the Venetians who financed the enterprise and ended up by seizing all the islands that lay on the trade routes they now monopolized.</p>
	  <p>The Fifth Crusade (1228-29) was led by the emperor Frederick II. A truce between Frederick and Moslems secured Jerusalem for the Christians, but Pope Gregory IX disapproved of such trucemaking with the heathens, and severely disciplined Frederick. Soon the Moslem captured the city again and two more Crusades (1248-54, and 1270) did nothing toward freeing the Holy City.</p>

	  <p><strong>The Black Death or Bubonic Plague</strong></p>
	  <p>The Black Death or Bubonic Plague is a disease that is caused by a germ called Yersinia pestis. It is spread to humans by fleas from infected rodents. The disease causes swelling of the lymph glands. The Greek word for groin is boubon, which is bubonic. The first symptoms are headaches, vomiting, and later most horribly: the skin turns black.<br/>
	  The most devastating outbreak of the Bubonic Plague was in 1346-51. It began in Kaffa, a town on the Crimean Coast. By the end of 1348, the plague covered all of Italy and most of France. By 1350 it had largely passed out of western Europe; it ended in Russia around 1351.<br/>
	  Over 25 million people died throughout Europe and for a time cultivation became impossible due to a shortage of hands. Nothing like that has happened before or since. In the space of two years, one out of every three people was dead.<br/>
	  These general numbers disguise the uneven nature of the epidemic. Some areas suffered little, others suffered far more. Here are some examples.<br/>
	  Between 45% and 75% of Florence died in a single year. 1/3 died in the first six months. Its entire economic system collapsed for a time.<br/>
	  In Venice, which kept excellent records, 60% died over the course of 18 months: 500-600 a day at the height.<br/>
	  Certain professions suffered higher mortality, especially those whose duties brought them into contact with the sick - doctors and clergy. In Montpellier, only seven of 140 Dominican friars survived. In Perpignan, only one of nine physicians survived, and two of 18 barber-surgeons.</p>

	  <p><strong>as the  </strong></p>
	  <p>In the late 1400's the House of  York fought the House of  Lancaster for the English crown. Because Lancaster's heraldic badge was a red rose and York's was a white rose, the long conflict came to be known as the  Wars of the Roses (1455 - 85).</p>
	  <p>The wars started when the nobles of York rose against Henry VI of Lancaster who was a feeble ruler. Edward IV, of York, replaced Henry as king.</p>
	  <p>Later, Henry again became king, but lost his crown once more to Edward after the battle of Tewkesbury in 1471. The Yorkists held power until Richard III lost his throne to the Lancastrian Henry Tudor.</p>
	  <p>Henry Tudor married into the House of York. This personal union ended the conflict, and a new famous dynasty, the  Tudors, emerged.</p>

	  <p><strong>Habsburgs</strong></p>
	  <p>The Habsburgs were one of the principal dynasties of Europe from the 15th to the 20th century.<br/>
	  The dynasty of the Habsburgs began when Pope Gregory X, in order to find support for a new crusade and to secure a counterweight to the king of Sicily, persuaded the German princes to elect the Count Rudolph of Habsburg emperor in 1273.<br/>
	  The real ascendancy of the Habsburgs began when Frederick V, the Habsburg king of Germany from 1440, was crowned Holy Roman emperor as Frederick III in 1452; this title remained in the family until 1806.<br/>
	  Some families have fought, others have intrigued their way to world power; the Habsburgs married their way. They began with Austria and then married - the lady's name scarely mattered - the Netherlands, Burgundy, the duchy of Milan, Sicily and finally Spain including all her dominions on the American continent.<br/>
	  The highpoint of Habsburg power came under Charles V (1500-58) who ruled over an empire over 'which the sun never set'.<br/>
	  The dynastic division at Charles death initiated the Spanish Habsburg line (until 1700) and the Austrian line which ruled the Habsburg posssessions in central Europe until 1918.</p>

	  <p><strong>Oversea Discoveries</strong></p>
	  <p>In the fifteenth century the Mongol rule in Asia collapsed and the overland trade they had encouraged fell off sharply. At the same time Arabic transit trade became more costly, because of heavy custom fees levied by the Ottoman Turks, who controlled the Black Sea trade.<br/>
	  The search for an alternative route to the Orient was initiated by Henry the Navigator a Portuguese Prince, who planned to outflank Islam with a circumnavigation of Africa. In 1488 the Portuguese rounded the cape of Africa and in 1498  Vasco da Gama reached the lucrative Indian market.<br/>
	  In Spain - only recently reconquered from the Moslems - European scholars had re-discovered ancient Greek texts which had been preserved by the Moslems. The new interest in Greek writing introduced the long forgotten idea of the global shape of the earth. An enthusiastic supporter of this theory was Christopher Columbus, who advanced the idea of sailing westwards around the world to China.<br/>
	  In 1492, after a journey of 61 days, Columbus landed in the Bahamas; in 1497 the Florentine John Cabot discovered the North American continent. Proof of the global shape of the earth was provided by the first circumnavigation by  Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese in the service of Spain. The Pacific coast was explored by the English naval hero  Francis Drake, while the French came into action through the exploration of the St. Lawrence river by  Jacques Cartier.</p>

	  <p><strong>The Fatimids</strong></p>
	  <p><img style="width:100%" src="images/islam1.gif"/></p>
	  <p>The Fatimids claimed descent from Fatima, the daughter of Mohammed.</p>
	  <p>As partisans of Ali, Fatima's husband, they were Shi'ites and they became leaders of the Isma'ili movement that began to organize the overthrow of the Abbaside caliphate. By 911, their leader who called himself al-Mahdi had been proclaimed the rightful caliph - or imam as the Shi'ites preferred.</p>
	  <p>The Fatimids conquered northern Africa and in 972 conquered Egypt where they founded a new capital, al-Kahira (Cairo), and established the famous university mosque al-Azhar.</p>
	  <p>The Fatimids ruled from Tunesia to Syria but after about 1060 Fatimid power declined and their rule was confined to Egypt. On the death of the last Fatimid caliph in 1171, Egypt again returned to the Sunni fold.</p>

	  <p><strong>Seljuks</strong></p>
	  <p>The Seljuks were a ruling familiy of the Ogus branch of the Turkish peoples who began settling in lands of the Abbasid caliphate, becoming Muslims, in the 10th century.</p>
	  <p>They established a local power, quickly expanded it and occupied Baghdad, capital of the caliphate, in 1055. They ruled most of the lands of the caliphate, under Abbasid suzerainty, with the title of sultan.</p>
	  <p>The empire split after the death of Nizam al-Mulk, but a branch remained as rulers of Anatolia (incorporated in the Muslim world by Seljuk conquest from the Byzantines) from the early 12th century until the Mongol conquest in the 13th century.</p>

	  <p><strong>The Mamlukes</strong></p>
	  <p>The Mamlukes were Turkish prisoners of Genghis Khan, who sold them as slaves to the Ayyubid Sultan of Egypt. The Sultan trained them as soldiers, and eventually they became his Palace guard.</p>
	  <p>In 1250, the Mamlukes seized control of Egypt, and ten years later they inflicted the first great defeat on the Mongol armies trying to seize Palestine. The Mamlukes overran Asia Minor, and they ruled Egypt for more than 250 years. Selim I of Turkey finally defeated them in 1517 and conquered Egypt.</p>
	  <p>Under Turkish rule the Mamlukes were kept on as soldiers. They attacked Napoleon when he invaded Egypt in 1798. In 1811, Egypt's Viceroy Mehemt Ali orderd the massacre of all Mamluks, and they disappeared from history.</p>

	  <p>Although he never took up permanent residence he strove to make his capital Samarkand the most splendid city in Asia. Before the beginning of a 'Holy War' against China the conqueror died and his empire with him.</p>

	  <p><strong>The Celts</strong></p>
	  <p>The Celts were a people that dominated western and central Europe during the first millenium BC. Their origins can be traced back to the Bronze Age Tumulus culture, which peaked around 1200 BC. They reached the highpoint of their power from the 5th-1st century BC, when they developed the so-called La Tene culture.</p>
	  <p>The Celts had many dealings with other cultures that bordered the lands occupied by these peoples, and even though there is no written record of the Celts stemming from their own documents, we can piece together a fair picture of them from historical accounts from other cultures.</p>
	  <p>The first historical recorded encounter of the Celts comes from northern Italy around 400 BC, when a previously unkown group of barbarians came down from the Alps and displaced the Etruscans from the fertile Po valley. These people were called Galli by the Romans and Galatai or Keltoi by the Greeks, terms meaning barbarian.</p>
	  <p>The most learned class among the Celts were the Druids, whose name means 'Knowing the Oak Tree' They seem to have frequented oak forests and acted as priests, judges, and teachers. The Druids' principal doctrine was that the soul was immortal and passed at death from one person to another. Many scholars believe that the Hindu Brahmin in the East and the Celtic Druid in the West were survivals of ancient Indo-European priesthood.</p>
	  <p>During the 1st century BC the Celts were caught between the expansion of the Roman Empire and the invasion of Germanic tribes and their world began to decline.</p>

	  <p><strong>Persian Wars</strong></p>
	  <p>In 499 B.C. the Greek cities of Ionia rebelled against Persian rule. The Persian king, Darius, crushed the revolt and sacked Miletus. Darius invaded Greece to punish Athens for the support of the failed revolt in Ionia. A first Persian invasion failed when the Persian fleet was destroyed in a storm off Mount Athos. A second expedition was decisively beaten by the Athenians and their allies on land at the  Battle of Marathon in 490 BC.</p>
	  <p>Xerxes, Darius' son and successor, launched a third expedition on a massive scale on land and sea. To avoid the risk of losing the fleet in a storm Xerxes ordered a canal to be dug through the Athos peninsula, a notoriously stormy area. As the army advanced along the Thracian coast Persian diplomats attempted to persuade the Greeks to submit. Many cities and the Greek oracle at Delphi decided to accept Persian terms, but some twenty cities, under the leadership of Sparta, refused to yield.</p>
	  <p>On August, 480 B.C., 300 Spartans and 5 600 other warriors died at Thermoplylae in a vain attempt to stop the Persian advance. Then, as Xerxes' army marched south, the Athenians were compelled to evacuate the city, which was burned by the Persians.</p>
	  <p>Yet the Persians had difficulty in supplying their army and Xerxes decided to attack the Greek fleet, which had taken refuge in the Strait of  Salamis near Athens. In the narrow Strait, the superior Persian fleet became disorganised and the Greeks, by skillful maneuvering, were able to win a decisive victory. Xerxes ordered an immediate retreat to prevent his army from being trapped.</p>
	  <p>A token army was left in Greece but this force was destroyed the following year at the Battle of  Plataea. After this defeat the Persians abandoned their expansionist aims and the independence of Greek civilization was secured.</p>

	  <p>Cleisthenes is regarded as the founder of Athenian democracy.</p>
	  <p>Cleisthenes served as chief archon in Athens in 525 BC. After the fall of the tyrant Hippias he established a democratic institution and he prepared Athens to face the Persian armies that threatened it.</p>
	  <p>He also introduced the practice of 'ostracism', or temporary banishment. His most important innovation was the basing of individual political responsibility on citizenship of a city rather than on membership of a clan.</p>
	  <p>In order to forestall strife between the traditional clans, which had led to the tyranny in the first place, he changed the political organisation from the four traditional tribes, which were based on family relations, into ten tribes according to their area of residence.</p>

	  <p><strong>ALEXANDER (356 - 323 BC)</strong></p>
	  <p><img src="images/alex.jpg"/></p>
	  <p>King of Macedonia. Alexander the Great was the first world conqueror and one of the greatest generals in history. He laid the foundation for the Hellenistic world, from Alexandria in Egypt to the borders of India.</p>
	  <p>Born in the Macedonian capital Pella Alexander was taught by Aristotle when he was 13, and he commanded the cavalry of his father when he was only 18. His father, Philip II, had united the Greek states in a confederacy against Persia, the world empire which had threatened Greece for a long time.</p>
	  <p>Alexander became king of Macedonia at the age of 20. After he consolidated his power over Greece he took up his fathers task of the Persian adventure.</p>
	  <p>In 334 BC Alexander crossed into Asia and systematically began the conquest of the Persian Empire. Everywhere he championed Greek ways and founded numerous cities, the most important of which was Alexandria in Egypt.</p>
	  <p>After 330 BC, when the Persian monarch was killed by his own troops, Alexander claimed to be his legitimate successor. He aspired to conquer the whole world, and was disappointed when his weary troops, after subduing the easternmost reaches of the Persian empire and invading northwestern India, refused to march any further.</p>
	  <p>After a difficult return trip to Babylon, the great conqueror died suddenly of a fever at age 33.</p>

	  <p>Following an uprising the separate Macedonian states were incorporated into the Roman empire in 148 B.C.</p>

	  <p>Rule of the Seleucides (304-64 B.C.), founded by Seleucus I (governor of Babylon).</p>
	  <p>Seleucus ruled over the territory of the conquered Persian empire. In exchange for 500 war elephants for the war against Antigonus of Macedonia Seleucus left the Indian provinces of the former Persian empire to Chandragupta who was the founder of the Maurya dynasty in India.</p>
	  <p>The vast empire could not be held together for long and the establishment of several kdms (Pergamum, Parthia) reduced the size of the Seleucid territory.</p>
	  <p>Antiochus III, the most important of the Seleucide rulers, fought with the Romans in Syria and Palestine. The empire was terminated by the Roman general Pompey in 64 B.C.</p>

	  <p>The Parni were a nomadic Scythian tribe located between the Caspian and Aral seas.</p>
	  <p>In 247 B.C. they invaded northern Iran and established the Parthian kingdom. They expanded their domination over all of Iran and Mesopotamia at the expense of the Seleucid empire. This brought them into conflict with Rome.</p>
	  <p>The superiority of the Parthian mounted bowmen led to a great victory at the battle of Carrhae (53 B.C.) over the Roman legions when the opposing general, Crassus, was killed. This victory halted further expansion eastwards of the Roman empire.</p>
	  <p>In A.D. 224, Ardashir, a local chieftain in southern Iran revolted against the Parthian rulers and established the Sassanian Empire.</p>

	  <p><strong>JESUS (c.6 BC - c. A.D. 30)</strong></p>
	  <p>Jesus Christos = ' the anointed one, or Messiah' ( in Hebrew ), also called Jesus of Nazareth, is the central personality and founder of the Christian faith. Son of God in Christianity.</p>
	  <p>The source for knowledge of his life are the four Gospels. Except for the recount of his birth in Bethlehem, his trip to Egypt, and a reference to the boy in the Temple, nothing is known of the years that intervened before his public ministry, which began when he was baptized by John the Baptist.</p>
	  <p>The disciples of Jesus were united in acknowledging his Resurrection after his death on the cross, an event that became the fundamental dogma in Christianity.</p>
